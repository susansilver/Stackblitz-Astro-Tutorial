    <p>Hello! I’m Suzza and I’m the writer with the mathematical muse. </p>
    <p>Strange, right?</p>
    <p> So often we’re told that we’re either good at Math or English. </p>
    <p>For some reason pursuing both seems a bit out of the ordinary.</p>
    <p> I fell in love with mathematics as a kid but we are an unlikely pair.</p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
  <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
  {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && 
    <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
  } 
</ul>
<p>My skills are:</p>
<ul>
  {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
</ul>

{happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

{finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

{goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
